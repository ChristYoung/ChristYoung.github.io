                            Integrate the in-hospital pharmacy and connect with external pharmaceutical companies' pharmacies and drug warehouses to provide patients with a self-directed and convenient prescription purchasing process. After doctors diagnose patients online, they will issue electronic prescriptions. Patients can choose their preferred pharmacy based on their location and sign a contract online. They can also choose their preferred method of picking up medication, such as online self-payment or in-person medical insurance payment.</p>

                        <p>4. This project is a product for N hospitals, with a baseline version. Each hospital may have customized requirements, so the entire project architecture will be refactored based on Angular Schematics development scaffolding tools. A standard template containing basic functions can be quickly built through the command line, and then custom requirements of users can be developed on the template. All customized modules will be aggregated into one project for unified management, similar to Lenra's management strategy of managing multiple front-end packages under one project.</p>

                            The pre-diagnosis system simulates the doctor's diagnosis process in the form of a dialogue robot before the patient visits the doctor, intelligently collects patient information including chief complaints, medical history, past history, etc., and generates an electronic medical record format of the pre-diagnosis report synchronized to the doctor to help them understand the patient's condition in advance. At the same time, the pre-diagnosis system can automatically generate standardized electronic medical record text into the EMR system, effectively saving doctors' time writing medical records, improving efficiency, and reducing patient waiting time.</p>
